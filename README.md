# Pentest scripts

I'm studying pentesting and do CTF challenges and lab exercises. I've learned that sometimes I need to be able to host simple .js files to test XSS/RFI, like yesterday when I was doing the Level 6 challenge in Google XSS Game. I'm reluctant to set up my own web server only for that purpose so instead I created this repository.

To use these files use link format:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<GitHub user name>/<GitHub repo name>/<script name>

E.g. https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Aurala/pentest-scripts/alert.js

Do not use raw GitHub links - modern browsers refuse to run the code because of the 'text/plain' MIME type.
